A quirky Node.js sandbox for exploring clean code, modular design, refactoring patterns, and backend scripting techniques.
Refactored
You're experimenting with taking messy or monolithic code and cleaning it up.

Practice rewriting logic into smaller, reusable functions

Move from callbacks → promises → async/await

Improve readability, naming, and structure Octo (Eight-Limbed Idea = Multi-Modular)
The project might branch into 8 different modules/tools/functions — like tentacles.

Example: a CLI tool, a logger, a file reader, a parser, a server, a test suite, etc.
